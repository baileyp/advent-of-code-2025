# Advent of Code 2025

These are my solutions for the [2025 Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## Requirements

 1. Latest Ruby (as of the time of this project) with RSpec

## Setup

None, other than satisfying the requirements, unless you want to run the tests and then `bundle install` is required.

## Running

```bash
ruby bin/run.rb <DAY> <PART>

# Example
ruby bin/run.rb 1 1
```

## Goals

- I am very busy this year so my primary goal is to just finish as many puzzles as possible.
- I will look for opportunities to re-use code between puzzles.
- I will look for opportunities to use Ruby features in interesting ways.
