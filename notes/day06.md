## Part 1

This wasn't too hard. Ruby's `Array#transpose` method is a great fit for this problem and the fact that math operators
can be passed to `Array#reduce` is some syntactic sugar that makes the code tidy.

## Part 2

Fascinating. For AOC puzzles, I don't usual consider the input parsing to be part of the problem solving, but this one
was a fun exception. I don't think I have the tidiest solution but I'm happy with it and ready to move on to the next puzzle.
