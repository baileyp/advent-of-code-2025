## Part 1

I didn't find this hard but it's very brute force. I did build in one performance optimization that skips ranges with
nothing but odd-length ids.

## Part 2

Second verse, same as the first - but even more brute force. I did get tripped up by single-digit ids but that was the
only edge case I ran into.
